# # Wright-Fisher model of evolution

# This is one of the simplest models of population genetics that demonstrates the
# use of [`sample!`](@ref).
# We implement a simple case of the model where we study haploids (cells with a single set
# of chromosomes) while for simplicity, focus only on one locus (a specific gene).
# In this example we will be dealing with a population of constant size.

# ## A neutral model

# * Imagine a population of `n` haploid individuals.
# * At each generation, `n` offsprings replace the parents.
# * Each offspring chooses a parent at random and inherits its genetic material.

using Agents
n = 100;

# Let's define an agent. The genetic value of an agent is a number (`trait` field).
mutable struct Haploid <: AbstractAgent
    id::Int
    trait::Float64
end

# And make a model without any spatial structure:
m = ABM(Haploid)

# Create `n` random individuals:
for i in 1:n
    add_agent!(m, rand())
end

# To create a new generation, we can use the `sample!` function. It chooses
# random individuals with replacement from the current individuals and updates
# the model. For example:
sample!(m, nagents(m));

# The model can be run for many generations and we can collect the average trait
# value of the population. To do this we will use a model-step function (see [`step!`](@ref))
# that utilizes [`sample!`](@ref):

modelstep_neutral!(m) = sample!(m, nagents(m));

# We can now run the model and collect data. We use `dummystep` for the agent-step
# function (as the agents perform no actions).
using Statistics: mean

data, _ = run!(m, dummystep, modelstep_neutral!, 20; adata = [(:trait,mean)])
data

# As expected, the average value of the "trait" remains around 0.5.

# ## A model with selection

# We can sample individuals according to their trait values, supposing that their
# fitness is correlated with their trait values.

m = ABM(Haploid)
for i in 1:100
    add_agent!(m, rand())
end

modelstep_selection!(m::ABM) = sample!(m, nagents(m), :trait)

data, _ = run!(m, dummystep, modelstep_selection!, 20; adata = [(:trait, mean)])
data

# Here we see that as time progresses, the trait becomes closer and closer to 1,
# which is expected - since agents with higher traits have higher probability of being
# sampled for the next "generation".
